Summary of my Analysis:  
-The average Trip Duration and the number of rides varies greatly within each season is at its highest in the summer starting in May this is mostly due to warmer weather and then dips down in the colder month  
-Weekends are very popular among casual riders precisely around 4 to 6 in the afternoon  
-In contrast we see a sharp increase in numbers of riders among members around 7 am and 4 pm this tells us that most of the members uses bikes to go to work  
-The most popular bike among with riders was the classic.

Suggestion:  
-The marketing team should lunch a marketing campain in May  
-personalize discount for new members
-create a family packages for new members in the busiest season of the year
